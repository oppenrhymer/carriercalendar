# carriercalendar
Prototype for a letter carrier calendar, which is specialized to provide day off schedules, federal holiday observances, and annual leave planning. I am currently using MS Visual Studio Community 2015 to code this.

A few things to note...

I taught myself how to program in C/C++ when I was younger but life took me on a different path. Lately, however, I  have been finding myself missing it, so I am attempting to relearn how to do it. This project is something I have considered doing for a while to help out my coworkers. At the time of upload, it looks rough and it is quite incomplete; however, it is very much a work in progress, and I fully intend to flesh it out and clean it up.
Also, this is my first submission to github and, as such, I am still learning the process.
